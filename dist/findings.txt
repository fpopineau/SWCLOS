* rdfs:resource is not finalized after loading everything under ACL. rdfs:Class is finalized.

* node.cl in LWW: not writing stuff results in bad code generation.

* after loading everything, owl:oneOf has a slotds slot. This slot has 3 values (subject type is owl:Class, rdfs:Class, rdfs:Datatype) for ACL and 9 values for LWW (subject type are the same plus shadowed-class, owl:restriction, owl:cardinalityrestriction, owl:hasValuesRectriction, owl:someValuesFromrestriction, owl:allValuesFromRestriction)

* while trying foo-owl.cl, College is added with url from topontologies.com under LWW and nil under ACL
Name:COLLEGE
URL:<http://www.TopOntologies.com/tools/SWCLOS#COLLEGE>
CLS:NIL

* in RdfsCore.cl, in addInstance
             ;; If name is a blank node ID, definitely it is bound to an default object.
blank node ID = (gensym) for LWW ?
